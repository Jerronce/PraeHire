# Flutterwave Payment Setup - $100 USD Worldwide

## ✅ Payment Configuration Updated

Your PraeHire app is now configured to accept **$100 USD** payments from **anywhere in the world**!

### Payment Details:
- **Amount**: $100 USD (one-time payment)
- **Currency**: USD (accepts international cards)
- **Payment Methods**: Credit/Debit cards, Bank transfers, Mobile money, and more
- **Access**: Lifetime access to all AI features

## 🚀 Final Setup Steps

### 1. Add Your Flutterwave Public Key

Open `js/payment.js` and replace line 5:

```javascript
const FLUTTERWAVE_PUBLIC_KEY = 'FLWPUBK-YOUR-PUBLIC-KEY-HERE';
```

With your actual Flutterwave public key from your dashboard.

### 2. Add Flutterwave Scripts to HTML Files

Add these two lines **before the closing `</body>` tag** in these files:
- `dashboard.html`
- `interview.html`
- `resume.html`

```html
<!-- Flutterwave Inline Payment -->
<script src="https://checkout.flutterwave.com/v3.js"></script>

<!-- Payment Integration -->
<script src="js/payment.js"></script>
```

### 3. Update dashboard.js to Require Payment

Add payment check to the `tailorResume()` function in `js/dashboard.js`:

```javascript
async function tailorResume() {
    // Check if user has paid
    const canProceed = await requirePayment('Resume Tailor');
    if (!canProceed) return;
    
    // Rest of your existing code...
    console.log('Tailoring resume...');
    // ... 
}
```

### 4. Update chat.js for Interview Practice

Add similar payment check in your message sending function in `js/chat.js`.

### 5. Deploy

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add international payment support - $100 USD"
git push
firebase deploy
```

## Security Notes

✅ **Public key in frontend is safe** - This is the intended use
❌ **Never put secret key in frontend** - Keep it server-side only
✅ **Payment verification** - Currently done in frontend, consider Firebase Functions for production
